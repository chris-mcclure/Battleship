# Battleship
Battleship project for CS372

Your assignment for Project 1 is fairly open ended. The overall goal is to implement Battleship. Along the way you will get experience in agile project planning, requirements, pair programming, TDD, source code control, software design, and writing clean code. Throughout the project you will be wearing two hats, as you will be both the Project Owner and the Developers. I expect your total time investment in this project to be around 15 hours each (outside of class time), but I would be delighted if you had so much fun you did more.

This assignment will be done in pairs, which will be chosen in class on Wednesday, 2/7.

While this will be at a much faster scale than a true Scrum or Agile project, I'd like you to go through the same steps you would there, to the extent that it is possible. Wednesday in class we'll brainstorm about user stories. After brainstorming, your first assignment as a team will be to have a planning session assigning difficulties (in points) to the features (wearing your developer hat) and also assign priorities to them (wearing your project owner hat.) You should prepare for this by reading "New to User stories?" and things like "the planning game." You should have a mini-planning meeting after every feature or two, similar to a Scrum "sprint planning meeting."

All project deliverables should be kept in a version control system. As soon as you have set it up, have one member of your group submit the URL on this assignment on Blackboard. Your first development session should be done as Pair Programming. After that, you may split up if you like, although I expect at least half of your overall development time to be done in Pairs.

All development should be done using at least some of the TDD philosophy. Whether you go full-blown "write one small test, make it pass, refactor" or just write some tests is up to your team. I do expect to see unit tests for each important class, and some evidence that you spent time refactoring your code to make it clean (think good variable names and small functions with few parameters!) and well designed.

While you are working on this project I would like each member of the team to keep a Project Diary. This should be extensive, specifically including details of how long you spent working on it (and what you were doing) and your project velocity (how many difficulty points per hour are you finishing?) I also want to see your thoughts about anything from this course you are using. I want to know how you felt while Pair Programming - did it keep you on task? Was it a lot slower than working by yourself? Did your code have fewer bugs, better design, better names, etc. I want to see similar comments about the planning process, doing TDD, clean code, using version control, etc. Everything we've covered in this course that you use or think about should be mentioned here. Your diary does not have to be a formal document, incomplete sentences and the like are fine, but it should be understandable.

Deliverables:

## Friday, February 9
* Version control URL
* Initial Requirements (prioritized User Stories with difficulties)
* Initial Design (2-3 minute presentation, very vague is fine, slides are not necessary but you may use them if you like.)
* Some Diary entries.

## Monday, February 19?
* TBD - some sort of demo

## Wednesday, February 28
* 8Working code
* All Diary entries
* Final project presentation
